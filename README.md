## About Summer Hacks 🌻
Summer Hacks is the first online hackathon organized by SOA Code Room in the month of May'21 to start engaging the students in hackathon activities.
In this hackathon we encourage students to experince a 2 day continous hackathon, explore ideas and technology, meet and greet people and learn some awesome things that they couldn't able to learn before. This hackathon mainly focus on contributing to GitHub and is based on GitHub.
The theme of the hackathon moves around the summer season. Students have to make a cool portfolio website with reference to our set of rules for this hackathon.
